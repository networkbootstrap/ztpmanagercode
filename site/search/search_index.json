What is this ZTPManager? ZTPManager is an application manager for the ISC-DHCP-SERVER which configures it for use in Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) scenarios. Initially created for Junos but with some feature enhancements can probably be used for other vendors. ZTPManager does: Configures dhcpd.conf file with basic info and hosts for each ZTP client. Creates initial configurations from templates for Juniper devices. Manages isc-dhcp-server file and serving interfaces. Provides a HTTP JSON API for configuration (super simple). Installs the ISC-DHCP-SERVER. You basically get your life back and stop trying to figure out how to configure a DHCP server for ZTP.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"This set of docs will guide you through installation and use of ZTPManager.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#what-is-this-ztpmanager","text":"ZTPManager is an application manager for the ISC-DHCP-SERVER which configures it for use in Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) scenarios.

One-Line Installer This is the easiest to get started with ZTPManager but it does rely on pulling a pre-compiled binary down from GitHub for x64_x86 architecture. If you don't like that and you think there might be some nasties hiding away, that's fine. Go check out the manual approach! The installer does this: Install ISC-DHCP-SERVER Install git Clones the ztpmanagerassets repository using git Writes elements of the configuration file from script input Creates config and images directories Launches ZTPmanager with the HTTP file interface running on port 80 and the configuration API running on port 1323. How to run this wonder? You must know what the interface on the server is that you would like to serve DHCP. In the example below it's ens34 . Secondly, you must know what URL you would like to access the server on. This could be a FQDN or just an IP address. Make sure you have curl installed. On Ubuntu this can be installed with sudo apt install curl . Here is the one line install. Copy and paste this in to your terminal. sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/networkbootstrap/ztpmanager/master/install.sh | bash -s -- --url=ztp.simpledemo.net --iface=ens34 Manual In order to do a manual install, you're required to have the Go tool-chain installed (written in 1.10), install the dependencies, build and them download the required assets to finish off the installation.
